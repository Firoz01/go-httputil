// Package helpers contains utility functions which are
// highly opionated and probably only applicable for specific use cases.
//
// Such use cases include consistent response structure for RESTful APIs,
// a predefined paginated response structure that also maintains the same
// structure defined for non-paginated RESTful APIs.
//
// Constants defined in this package are purely to maintain a pre-defined
// response structure.
